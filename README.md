This project let user scan QR code, and detect if the link is from PDF file,

- if yes, app will open it automatically when the QR code is detected
- if not, app will display message to say "this file is not a pdf".

The project based on mobile vision barcode API from Google with some modification to open pdf file automatically without need to tap on the screen, and 
support pdf file only for now.

To test the project, install app on the phone, and open sample_pdf.pdf file from root project, and then scan the QR code with this app.
